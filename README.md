# Neural_Network_PIV

PIV_Code is a custom-built PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) code that synthetically generates random velocity fields and performs cross-correlation PIV analysis. The methodology and implementation of the code are detailed in the accompanying research paper (to be available on arXiv soon). Please note that the code is currently under development.

Additionally, we provide Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of Feedforward and Convolutional Neural Networks to the same velocity fields analyzed using cross-correlation PIV.

If you utilize any part of this work, please cite the research paper once it becomes available.
