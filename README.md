# Neural_Network_PIV

One_Dimensional_Synthetic_PIV is a custom-built PIV (Particle Image Velocimetry) code that synthetically generates random velocity fields and performs cross-correlation PIV analysis including subpixel correction, outlier detection and correlation strength check. The methodology and implementation of the code are detailed in the accompanying research paper. Please note that the paper is currently under development.

Additionally, we provide Jupyter notebooks demonstrating the application of Feedforward and Convolutional Neural Networks to the same velocity fields analyzed using cross-correlation PIV.

If you utilize any part of this work, please cite the research paper once it becomes available.
